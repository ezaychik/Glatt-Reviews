# Glatt-Reviews

This is a project to allow reviews of different service providers while avoiding problems of slander, which could cause significant financial loss.

Instead of rating the service providers, consumers will desccribe the service they received, the person from whom they received it, and leave contact information. 

Any subsequent potential consumer of said service, can browse the reviews, and contact whomever they see fit, to get a full picture of the transaction in question.

Our hope is to assist consumers while protecting providers.
